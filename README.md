# Group_And_Gender_Distribution_Analysis
This R project performs a distribution analysis based on group and gender using user-defined functions. By avoiding built-in R functions, custom functions are developed to analyze and visualize how different groups are distributed across gender categories, providing deeper insights into the dataset.
